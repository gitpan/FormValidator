HTML::FormValidator
===================

Version: 0.11

Description
-----------

HTML::FormValidator validates user input (usually from an HTML form)
based on an input profile. It's main aim is to make the tedious coding
of input validation expressible in a simple format and to let the
programmer focus on more interesting task.

When you are coding web application one of the most tedious though
crucial task is to validate user's input (usually submitted by way of
an HTML form). You have to check that each required fields is present
and that some feed have valid data. (Does the phone input looks like a
phone number ? Is that a plausible email address ? Is the YY state
valid ? etc.) For simple form, this is not really a problem but as
forms get more complex and you code more of them this task became
really boring and tedious.

HTML::FormValidator lets you defines profiles which defines the
required fields and their format. When you are ready to validate the
user's input, you tell HTML::FormValidator the profile to apply to the
user data and you get the valid fields, the name of the fields which
are missing, the name of the fields that contains invalid input and
the name of the fields that are unknown to this profile.

You are then free to use this information to build a nice display to
the user telling which fields that he forgot to fill.
